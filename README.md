# Natural Bridge Valley

# Introduction:
## Natural Bridge was established as a State Park in 1926. It was a major tourist destination before that though. The arch stretches 78 feet and is 65 feet high, the top where you can walk across spans 30 feet wide.

## Once you either hike up to Natural Bridge or take the sky lift, you can take a 10-15 minute hike over to Battleship Rock for a great view of Natural Bridge and the surrounding valley.

# Goals:
## The goal of this project is to showcase Natural Bridge Valley and offer different views utilizing different maps and photos of the area.
